## Key Insights

### Why Multi-Agent Performs Better

1. **Planner Phase** ✅
   - Creates comprehensive plan
   - Identifies key factors and challenges
   - Sets up systematic approach

2. **Executor Phase** ✅
   - Executes plan thoroughly
   - Provides detailed analysis
   - Quantifies impacts

3. **Reviewer Phase** ✅
   - **Critical value-add**: Identifies gaps
