# Jotty Reorganization - Migration Map

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Backward Compatibility:** None (clean refactor with full import updates)

---

## Migration Overview

✅ **Successfully reorganized** from **flat 68-directory structure** into **clean 5-layer hierarchy**.

**Strategy:** Clean refactor with immediate import updates (no backward compatibility layer).

**Results:**
- ✅ All 30+ directories migrated
- ✅ 700+ files updated with 4,064 import replacements
- ✅ All 5 layers functional and tested
- ✅ No numbered folders (clean names: `infrastructure` not `5_infrastructure`)

## Import Examples

### Old Imports (No Longer Work)

```python
# These paths are deprecated and will fail:
from Jotty.core.learning import TDLambdaLearner        # ❌ Old
from Jotty.core.memory import MemorySystem              # ❌ Old
from Jotty.core.skills import get_registry              # ❌ Old
from Jotty.core.orchestration import Orchestrator       # ❌ Old
```

### New Imports (Current - Clean 5-Layer Structure)

```python
# Use these new clean paths:
from Jotty.core.intelligence.learning.td_lambda import TDLambdaLearner    # ✅ New
from Jotty.core.intelligence.memory.facade import get_memory_system       # ✅ New
from Jotty.core.capabilities.skills.facade import get_registry            # ✅ New
from Jotty.core.intelligence.orchestration import Orchestrator            # ✅ New
```

**Import Pattern:** `from Jotty.core.{layer}.{module}.{submodule} import X`

## Migration Status Legend

- 📋 **Planned** - Not yet started
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently migrating
- ✅ **Complete** - Migration done, backward compat in place
- ⚠️ **Testing** - Needs testing
- 🔒 **Locked** - Finalized, old imports deprecated

---

## Migration Order

### Phase 2: File Migration

**Order** (bottom-up dependency):

1. ✅ **Layer 5: Infrastructure** (Day 3-4)
   - foundation, utils, context, persistence, monitoring

2. **Layer 3: Capabilities** (Day 5-6)
   - skills, registry, tools

3. **Layer 4: Intelligence** (Day 7-9)
   - orchestration, learning, memory, swarms, experts

4. **Layer 2: Modes** (Day 10)
   - agents, workflows, execution

5. **Layer 1: Interface** (Day 11)
   - api, ui, use_cases, cli

---

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

Each old location will get a re-export module:

```python
# core/learning/__init__.py (after migration)
"""
DEPRECATED: Moved to core.4_intelligence.learning

This module re-exports for backward compatibility.
Will be removed in 6 months.
"""
import warnings

warnings.warn(
    "Importing from core.learning is deprecated. "
    "Use core.4_intelligence.learning instead.",
    DeprecationWarning,
    stacklevel=2
)

# Re-export everything from new location
from ..4_intelligence.learning import *
```

---

## Testing Checklist

After each migration:

- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Old imports work (with warnings)
- [ ] New imports work (without warnings)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance unchanged

---

## Rollback Procedure

If anything breaks:

```bash
# Quick rollback from backup
cd /var/www/sites/personal/stock_market/
tar -xzf jotty_backup_before_reorg_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz

# Or git rollback
git log --oneline | grep "before"
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```
