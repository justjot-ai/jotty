# Financial Analysis Report

## RELIANCE (REL)

### 1. Company Overview
Reliance is a diversified conglomerate with operations across energy, petrochemicals, retail, and telecommunications sectors. It holds a dominant position in Indian markets.

### 2. Financial Performance

**Revenue & Profit Trends:**
- Sales: ₹125,849 → ₹127,695 Cr (5-year view shows volatility)
- Net Profit: ₹8,373 → ₹9,924 Cr (18.5% growth from base, but peaked at ₹13,806 Cr mid-period)

**Profitability Ratios:**
- ROE: 6.61% (concerningly low for a large-cap)
- ROCE: 7.57% (below inflation, indicates capital inefficiency)
- Operating margins: ~12-15% range

### 3. Financial Health

**Balance Sheet:**
- Equity doubled (₹3,232 → ₹6,335 Cr) - possible rights issue/split
- Reserves grew steadily: ₹193,859 → ₹308,312 Cr
- **Borrowings increased**: ₹89,968 → ₹116,881 Cr (+30%) - rising leverage

**Concerns:** Increasing debt load with subpar returns on capital

### 4. Valuation

- P/E: 47.2 (severely overvalued relative to earnings)
- P/B: 3.35× (Price ₹1,386 / Book ₹413)
- Market Cap: ₹18.75 lakh Cr
- Dividend Yield: 0.40% (negligible income)
- Stock traded 52W high of ₹1,612 (currently -14% below)

### 5. Investment Thesis

**Strengths:**
- Diversified business model
- Strong reserves base
- Scale and market dominance

**Key Risks:**
- **Extremely poor capital efficiency** (6-7% returns)
- **Valuation disconnect**: 47× PE with single-digit ROE
- Rising debt with stagnant profitability
- Inconsistent earnings trajectory

**Recommendation: AVOID** ⚠️
The valuation (47× PE) is unjustifiable given 6.61% ROE. Investors are paying premium multiples for below-par returns. The company destroys shareholder value at current return rates.

- P/B: 13.5× (Price ₹3,162 / Book ₹235)
- Market Cap: ₹11.44 lakh Cr
- Dividend Yield: 1.90% (moderate income)

### 5. Investment Thesis

**Strengths:**
- **Best-in-class profitability** (65-78% returns)
- Zero debt with strong cash generation
- Consistent dividend payer
- Defensive business model
- 24% correction from highs provides entry opportunity

**Key Risks:**
- Revenue growth stagnation (<4% CAGR)
- Earnings flat-lined last 5 years
- IT sector headwinds (discretionary spending cuts)
- High P/B suggests limited margin of safety

**Recommendation: HOLD/BUY ON DIP** ✓
At 23.4× PE with 65% ROE, TCS offers quality at reasonable price post-correction. The company generates exceptional returns on capital with zero leverage risk. However, growth concerns warrant accumulation only at attractive valuations (below ₹3,000 preferred).
