- Borrowings: ₹116,881 Cr (increasing trend from ₹89,968 Cr)
- Debt-to-Equity: ~0.37 (manageable but rising)

**Concerns:**
- Debt increasing 30% over the period
- Book value of ₹413 vs market price suggests leverage/capitalization changes

## 4. Valuation

**Key Metrics:**
- **P/E Ratio: 47.2** - Highly expensive (market expects strong recovery)
- **P/B Ratio: 3.36** (₹1,386 / ₹413) - Premium to book value
- **Dividend Yield: 0.40%** - Minimal income return
- **52-week High/Low: ₹1,612** - Currently 14% below peak

**Valuation Assessment:** Significantly overvalued based on current fundamentals

## 5. Investment Thesis

### Key Strengths:
- Market leadership and brand strength
- Diversified business model across sectors
- Strong equity base of ₹3.15 lakh crores

### Key Risks:
- **Deteriorating profitability**: ROE/ROCE both under 8%
- **Declining earnings**: Net profit down 11.5%
- **Revenue volatility**: Inconsistent sales trajectory
- **Rising debt burden**: 30% increase in borrowings
- **Extreme valuation**: P/E of 47.2 vs declining earnings

### Investment Recommendation: **AVOID / SELL**

**Reasoning:**
The combination of declining profitability (ROE 6.61%, ROCE 7.57%), falling net profits, increasing debt, and an exceptionally high P/E ratio of 47.2 creates significant downside risk. The company would need to grow earnings at ~20-25% annually just to justify current valuations, which contradicts recent performance trends. The minimal 0.40% dividend yield offers no cushion. **Wait for either significant business improvement or substantial price correction (30-40%) before considering investment.**
