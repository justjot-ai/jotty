## 4. Valuation

| Metric | Reliance | TCS | Analysis |
|--------|----------|-----|----------|
| **P/E Ratio** | 47.2x | 23.4x | Reliance trading at premium |
| **P/B Ratio** | 3.36x | 13.5x | TCS commands higher multiple |
| **Dividend Yield** | 0.40% | 1.90% | TCS offers better yield |
| **Price to High** | 86% | 76% | Both off 52-week highs |

**Valuation Assessment:**
- **Reliance:** High P/E (47.2x) appears expensive relative to ~7% returns and modest growth
- **TCS:** P/E of 23.4x is reasonable given 65% ROE and stable business model
- TCS's high P/B justified by exceptional return metrics

## 5. Investment Thesis

### RELIANCE

**Key Strengths:**
✓ Dominant market position across multiple sectors  
✓ Improving profitability trends (+19% net profit growth)  
✓ Strategic investments in new energy and digital  
✓ Strong reserves and diversification

**Key Risks:**
✗ Low ROE/ROCE (6-7%) relative to valuation  
✗ Very high P/E ratio (47.2x) not justified by returns  
✗ Cyclical business exposure  
✗ High debt levels (₹1.17 lakh crores)  
✗ Fluctuating revenue trends

**Recommendation:** **HOLD/AVOID** - Valuation appears stretched. P/E of 47x is unjustifiable for a company generating <7% ROE. Wait for better entry point below 35x earnings.

---

### TCS

**Key Strengths:**
✓ Exceptional capital efficiency (65% ROE, 78% ROCE)  
✓ Debt-free balance sheet  
✓ Consistent profitability and cash generation  
✓ Reasonable P/E (23.4x) for quality  
✓ Higher dividend yield (1.9%)  
✓ Predictable, recurring revenue model

**Key Risks:**
✗ Modest revenue growth (+3%)  
✗ Currency and wage inflation pressures  
✗ Global economic uncertainty  
✗ High P/B ratio (13.5x)

**Recommendation:** **BUY** - Superior quality business at reasonable valuation. P/E of 23x is justified by exceptional 65% ROE and capital-light model. Better risk-reward profile than Reliance.

---

## Summary Verdict

**For Quality & Value:** TCS is the clear winner
- 10x better capital efficiency
- Debt-free balance sheet  
- More reasonable valuation (23.4x vs 47.2x P/E)
- Higher dividend yield

**For Growth/Turnaround:** Reliance shows operational improvement but valuation remains a concern. Only attractive below ₹1,000 (30x P/E).

**Portfolio Allocation Suggestion:** TCS 70% | Reliance 30% (if diversification needed)
