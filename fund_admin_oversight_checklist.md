# Fund Administration Oversight Company: Board Governance Checklist

## **Regulatory Compliance & Board Oversight**
- [ ] Quarterly attestation by Chief Compliance Officer on adherence to Form ADV Part 2A updates and material changes
- [ ] Board review of sweep testing results for client cash management compliance (daily interest calculations, FDIC coverage)
- [ ] Annual assessment of cross-border data transfer protocols under GDPR/local privacy laws for international fund structures
- [ ] Quarterly validation of beneficial ownership reporting accuracy under Corporate Transparency Act requirements

## **Risk Management & Fiduciary Controls**
- [ ] Monthly reconciliation variance analysis exceeding 0.01% of NAV flagged for board review
- [ ] Independent validation of pricing vendor hierarchy and stale price monitoring (securities unchanged >5 days)
- [ ] Quarterly stress testing of operational capacity during 40% AUM surge scenarios
- [ ] Annual cyber insurance coverage adequacy assessment tied to AUM multiples

## **Operational Controls & Performance Metrics**
- [ ] Daily STP (Straight-Through-Processing) rate monitoring with <95% triggering escalation protocols
- [ ] Trade settlement failure analysis with counterparty concentration limits (max 15% with single prime)
- [ ] Monthly review of service level agreement breaches and penalty assessments

## **Financial Reporting & Transparency**
- [ ] Quarterly fee calculation audits with variance tolerance of <$1,000 per fund
- [ ] Annual Type II SOC 1 report review focusing on complementary user entity controls (CUECs) gaps
- [ ] Board certification of management representation letters to fund auditors

## **Investor Relations & Stakeholder Management**
- [ ] Semi-annual limited partner advisory committee reporting on operational incidents >$50K impact
- [ ] Quarterly analysis of redemption pattern anomalies indicating potential investor concerns

## **Governance Innovation**
**Often Overlooked**: Establish **"Control Environment Rotation"** protocols—systematically rotating board oversight focus across different operational areas quarterly to prevent oversight fatigue and ensure comprehensive coverage. This includes rotating external audit firms every 7 years specifically for operational reviews, separate from financial audits.

**Critical Gap**: Implement board-level monitoring of AI/automation deployment in fund operations, including algorithm bias testing and human oversight checkpoints for automated NAV calculations.
